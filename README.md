#steps to run the application:

#1. Ensure you have installed Node.js in your system.

#3. Now open command prompt in project root directory( ie. Airline, where the src, build folders and remaining files are present) and type "json-server db.json -- port 3001". this command will make our json server up and running. 
#4. Open another command prompt in root directory, and type "npm start". this command will start development server at http:localhost:8000. if you want to change the port, go to package.json , check for npm start property under scripts and change it to port number you like.
